I just wanted to post this so everyone can see a little more detailed instruction on the chat mod ^_^
Also to let everyone know if you need help with mods just hit me up 
        
:bangbang: You have to add all the mods while the game is closed:bangbang:

you need to install this first its pretty similar to how you install optifine 
You have to run this file its like any programm you dont have to put it anywhere ^-^
https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/

Then in your minecraft launcher it should say Fabric loader version ...
You have to run this Profile once
you should now have a mod folder in your mc directory (if you need more help lmk :D)

Access it by pressing windows key + r and there you type %appdata%
IT should look like this

And In the mod folder you'll just put in all these mods

These are dependency mods required for the chat mods ^_^

And these are the actual chat mods
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/advancedchatcore
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/advancedchathud
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/advancedchatlog

If you want to keep optifine you have to put this in the mod folder too
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/optifabric
And also the optifine jar you get from
https://www.optifine.net/downloads

Also this mod menu is helpful for configurating all the mods but its not required

A little tip if you change anything in the chat mod settings 
you probably should rejoin the server cause sometimes the filter dont work properly if you dont ^^

Here is a little preview how it looks on my end i get it looks kinda cluttered at first 
but its way better then having all msgs in the same window ^_^

If you like it you can use my config files so it looks the same and you can customize it more from there

[BLU3NINJ4advancedchatconfig.zip](https://github.com/BLU3NINJ4/Advanced-Chat-setup-tutorial/files/9933796/BLU3NINJ4advancedchatconfig.zip)
These you have to put in the advancedchat folder in the config folder in the minecraft directory 
it should be a bit above the mods folder

When it asks you if you want to replace the old files say yes ^^
