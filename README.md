I just wanted to post this so everyone can see a little more detailed instruction on the chat mod ^_^
Also to let everyone know if you need help with mods just hit me up :girldmsalute: 
        
:bangbang: You have to add all the mods while the game is closed:bangbang:

you need to install this first its pretty similar to how you install optifine 
You have to run this file its like any programm you dont have to put it anywhere ^-^
https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/
Then in your minecraft launcher it should say Fabric loader version ...
You have to run this Profile once
you should now have a mod folder in your mc directory (if you need more help lmk :D)
Access it by pressing windows key + r and there you type %appdata%
In the mod folder you'll just put in all these mods

These are dependency mods required for the chat mods ^_^

If you want to keep optifine you have to put this in the mod folder too
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/optifabric
And also the optifine jar you get from
https://www.optifine.net/downloads

Also this mod menu is helpful for configurating all the mods but its not required

A little tip if you change anything in the chat mod settings you probably should rejoin the server cause sometimes the filter dont work properly if you dont ^^

Here is a little preview how it looks on my end i get it looks kinda cluttered at first but its way better then having all msgs in the same window ^_^

If you like it i could send you my config files so it looks the same and you could customize it from there
